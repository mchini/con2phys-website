CON²PHYS is a collaborative study that aims to quantify how much consensus exists among system
neuroscientists when interpreting fundamental concepts and analyses from in vivo electrophysiological data (LFP and SUA).

The full project including instructions on how to participate are described in [this]((https://mchini.github.io/con2phys/)) website.

If you are here because of the Pre-Cosyne Brainhack, which will be based on CON²PHYS, [this](https://pre-cosyne-brainhack.github.io/hackathon2026/) 
is the website where you will find all the info on how to apply.
