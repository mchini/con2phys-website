# Contributions and manuscript 

## Contributions and authorship
Participation consists of analysing the shared electrophysiology dataset, filling out the questionnaire and the submission form.
All substantive submissions will be rewarded with the opportunity of being a co-author on the manuscript.

## Data and code management
All data and code used for the project will be released publicly at publication.  
Participants retain ownership of their own analytical code but grant the organizers permission to inspect it for the purpose of interpreting results.

For any doubt concerning these matters, please send an email to [Mattia Chini](mailto:mchini@uliege.be).
