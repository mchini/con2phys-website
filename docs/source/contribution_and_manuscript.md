# Contributions and manuscript 

## How contributions work
Participation consists of analysing the shared electrophysiology dataset and submitting answers to the multiple-choice questions. 
Every submission contributes to the central goal of quantifying conceptual variability in systems neuroscience.
All substantive submissions will be rewarded with the opportunity of being a co-author on the manuscript

Participants are expected to:
- Analyse the dataset using their preferred tools and standard workflow.
- Answer all items in the submission form, including belief metrics and methodological notes.
- Provide enough information for the analysis team to interpret methodological choices.

## Authorship and acknowledgement
All contributors who complete the full set of questions and provide a valid submission will be invited as co-authors on the resulting publication.  
This includes:
- A complete set of categorical answers
- Quantitative estimates
- Belief metrics
- A brief description of the analytical approach

Additional contributors (e.g., collaborators, tool builders, or organizers) may be acknowledged or included according to standard authorship practices.

## Data and code management
All data and code used for the project will be released publicly at publication.  
Participants retain ownership of their own analytical code but grant the organizers permission to inspect it for the purpose of interpreting results.

## Governance principles
CON²PHYS follows a simple governance model:
- **Transparency**: All questions, data, and analysis procedures are openly documented.  
- **Neutrality**: The project does not prescribe analytical methods.  
- **Reproducibility**: Submissions must be sufficiently documented to understand how results were produced.  
- **Community orientation**: The outcomes are intended to benefit the entire field by clarifying where conceptual consistency exists and where it breaks down.
