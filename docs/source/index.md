## CONceptual CONsistency in electroPHYSiology

According to Thomas Kuhn, a pre-paradigmatic field is a scientific discipline lacking a consensus conceptual framework, 
where foundational assumptions and methods vary widely among practitioners. Without shared foundational
ground, researchers struggle to reliably build on earlier work, resulting in extensive debate and continuous 
redefinition of core concepts instead of scientific progress. **Is systems neuroscience a pre-paradigmatic field?**  
We think that the field shows clear signs of conceptual fragmentation. Terms like “representation”, “functional
connectivity” or "gamma oscillations" are central to our research, yet their definitions and implementations 
shift across subfields and labs. Do these differences make a difference? That’s precisely the question that **CON²PHYS** sets out to answer.

**CON²PHYS** is a collaborative study that aims to quantify how much consensus exists among neuroscientists when interpreting fundamental 
concepts and analyses from in vivo electrophysiological data (LFP and SUA).  
To address this, we intentionally ask seemingly basic and deliberately underspecified questions that map to core system neuroscience concepts. 
Our goal is precisely to uncover how neuroscientists operationalize these concepts in their standard practice and to uncover how 
(necessarily) arbitrary algorithm or parameter choices might lead us to different answers. We want you to answer these questions 
with your preferred analytical pipeline and your preferred hyper-parameters, so that the study will be a representative “simulation” 
of how the community would answer a high-level scientific question. We aim to recruit neuroscientists at all seniority levels and from all disciplines: 
from computational to cellular neuroscience, and everything in between.
